        <h3>What is Dishcovery?</h3>
        <div>
            <p>Dishcovery is a community-driven website that allows users to share, explore, and rate recipes from all
                over the world. It's designed to highlight the cultural richness behind every dish.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Do I need an account to use Dishcovery?</h3>
        <div>
            <p>You can browse recipes without an account, but to share recipes, rate them, or leave comments, you'll
                need to create a free account.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>What makes Dishcovery different from other recipe websites?</h3>
        <div>
            <p>Every recipe on Dishcovery comes with a cultural background or personal story, so you're not just
                learning how to cook, you're learning that dish matters to someone and where it comes from.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Can I upload my own recipes?</h3>
        <div>
            <p>Yes! Once you're logged in, you can submit your own recipes along with photos, step-by-step instructions,
                and a personal or cultural story behind the dish.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>How is content organized?</h3>
        <div>
            <p>Recipes are categorized by cuisine, difficulty, meal type, and diet preferences, making it easy to
                discover new dishes tailored to your tastes or dietary needs.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>How do ratings work?</h3>
        <div>
            <p>Logged-in users can rate any recipe on a scale of 1-10, helping others find the most loved and trusted
                dishes in the community.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Is Dishcovery free to use?</h3>
        <div>
            <p>Yes! Dishcovery is completely free to use and contribute to.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Can I interact with other users?</h3>
        <div>
            <p>While direct messaging isn't available, you can engage with others by commenting on recipes, sharing
                feedback, and rating dishes.</p>
